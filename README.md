# CS-305-Software-Security
## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a company looking to establish a secure online presence for its financial services. Because the company handles sensitive financial data, it is a prime target for cyberattacks. Artemis needed a secure software solution to protect its users’ information, maintain compliance with industry regulations, and prevent financial fraud. Our task was to assess potential security vulnerabilities in their system and recommend improvements to strengthen their overall cybersecurity posture.
## What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
One of the key strengths in our vulnerability assessment was a thorough review of the system's architecture and codebase to identify weaknesses. We conducted static code analysis to detect insecure coding patterns and potential attack vectors, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and improper authentication mechanisms.Coding securely is crucial because financial and personal data must be protected from breaches that could lead to financial loss, legal penalties, and reputational damage. Security must be integrated from the first line of code. A well-secured application builds user trust, ensures regulatory compliance, and prevents costly security incidents that could impact a company’s future.
## Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One of the challenges was performing a hands-on security assessment rather than just reviewing reports. While I had experience interpreting security test results, actively running static analysis tools and reviewing dynamic testing results was a learning opportunity. This hands-on experience helped solidify my understanding of how vulnerabilities are detected in real-world applications.
## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
A fundamental security principle is never trusting input, whether it comes from a user, an API, or even a trusted internal database. To improve Artemis Financial’s security, I implemented input validation, parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and enhanced authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication. For future vulnerability assessments, I would use a combination of static and dynamic analysis tools, threat modeling, and penetration testing to identify weaknesses. When deciding on mitigation techniques, I would follow industry best practices, such as OWASP’s security guidelines, and prioritize risks based on potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.
## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After refactoring, I conducted unit and integration testing to verify that security improvements didn’t break functionality. I also reran security scans to check if new vulnerabilities were introduced. 
## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Dynamic security testing was conducted to analyze how the application responded to real-world threats, helping to uncover runtime vulnerabilities. To maintain a secure software environment, I used dependency management tools such as Maven to keep third-party libraries up to date and free from known vulnerabilities. Additionally, adhered to secure coding practices, including input validation, encryption for sensitive data, and compliance with OWASP security guidelines, to strengthen overall application security.
## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The most valuable takeaway from this project was developing a secure API using Spring Boot, which involved implementing authentication, data validation, and encryption. One specific highlight was building a checksum generator to verify data integrity, showcasing my ability to develop secure, scalable, and well-structured applications. This project demonstrated my understanding of software security, secure coding practices, and hands-on vulnerability assessment.
