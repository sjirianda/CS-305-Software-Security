# CS-305-Software-Security
## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a company looking to establish a secure online presence for its financial services. Because the company handles sensitive financial data, it is a prime target for cyberattacks. Artemis needed a secure software solution to protect its users’ information, maintain compliance with industry regulations, and prevent financial fraud. Our task was to assess potential security vulnerabilities in their system and recommend improvements to strengthen their overall cybersecurity posture.
## What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
One of the key strengths in our vulnerability assessment was a thorough review of the system's architecture and codebase to identify weaknesses. We conducted static code analysis to detect insecure coding patterns and potential attack vectors, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and improper authentication mechanisms.Coding securely is crucial because financial and personal data must be protected from breaches that could lead to financial loss, legal penalties, and reputational damage. Security must be integrated from the first line of code. A well-secured application builds user trust, ensures regulatory compliance, and prevents costly security incidents that could impact a company’s future.
